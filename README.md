Hi, this game has been created to test the effectiveness of chance mechanics in video games.
These mechanics are all around us when we are playing games, some are more subtle than others.

These mechanics aim to provide the user with a fun way to earn something within the game...
This can range from a new cosmetic item all the way to a rare item that gives the player an advantage.

Although this game allows users to partake in these mechanics through the use of in game currency
it is important to note that there are similar mechanics in popular video games that require the user to part
with their real world money.

This game aims to analyse how effective these mechanics are, how much will a user spend on trying to chase a winning
roll, will the user stop trying after a losing streak? Or will they keep pouring currency in the hopes of recouping all
of their loses.

I understand that this is an extremly primative way to measure this, and sice I dissagree with making users pay real money to 
get the chance of winning something, this is the closest way that I could come up with giving the in game currency a real
world value.

My thinking was that to earn the currency, users have to put time into the game, this time could be used to do other things, and 
since time is money, Im hoping that the time that users put in will somewhat give credability to my results.

Users spend currency to make currency, buying upgrades to increase the rate in which they earn currency. But if the user 
wants to speed up this process, they can play a game of chance, this chance gives the user currecy if they win and thereby
giving them the ability to upgrade more things that they would have otherwise had to have worked for.

But if the user loses the game of chance, then they have lost currency that they could have otherwise held onto and used 
to buy an upgrade in the future.

I hope to understand why these mechanics are so widely used by game developers around the world and whether or not they are as bad as 
I think they are.
