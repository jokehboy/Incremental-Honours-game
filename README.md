# Incremental-Honours-game
This game was created for my honours project, it is not perfect but I was under a time limit, hopefully you will
enjoy it even though it isnt as good as it could have been!!!

# What data is being collected??? #

Due to the current situation, I cannot ask people to sit in a room and play my game for "Research purposes", so to overcome this, I decided to use unity analytics. Since there is no need for specific user data such as their name, age occupation etc. (which shouldn't be needed as much as it seems to be needed now to do simple tasks online) I opted to use unity analytics to just collect anonymous game data.

Unity analytics is literally just collecting a few variables from the game data script, that's it. But due to data protection laws, rules and regulations, I am obligated to tell you that I am in fact taking this data and in the process, make it sound as scary and intrusive as possible. 

If you want to help me in this study, please allow me the privilege of collecting a few variables in the background while you play my game :) 

## How to play ##

The game is very simple, click the button to earn currency, spend that currency on upgrades to improve the rate in
which currency is earned.

### Upgrades ###
On the upgrades or production page, there are upgrade panels, these panels have 6 sections.

* Upgrade name, top left of the panel, this is a short description of the upgrade.
* Upgrade level, top right of the panel, this shows you what level the current upgrade is at.
* Upgrade description, middle of the panel, this describes what the upgrade does.
* Upgrade cost, bottom of the panel, this is how much it will cost to upgrade by one level.
* Buy buttons, underneath the panel, this allows you to purchase the upgrade, there are 3 buttons, each are labelled with how many times you are buying the upgrade.
* Progress bar, underneath the buy buttons, this is a visual representation of how much currency/product you need to purchase one upgrade level.

### Games ###

This section of the game is where you can gamble your hard earned currency to gain more currency. There are 3 games:

* Coin flip
* Spin the wheel
* Dice roulette

#### Coin flip ####

If you wish to play, you must first specify how much you wish to bet using the + and - buttons on the panel.
After you have decided how much you wish to bet, you then select whether you think the outcome will be heads or tails.
Once you have made your selection, you press the bet button and cross your fingers!

#### Spin the wheel ####

With this game, you must choose how much you want to bet using the + and - buttons within the panel.
Once you have done that, you can then bet that amount and the wheel will spin! 

#### Dice roulette ####

![fsdfsdg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27737718/113463397-625a9c80-941d-11eb-8e4d-ad52e5293e89.PNG)

This game is a little more complex but it has better payouts! There are two sections:

* Bet option 
* Bet setting

The bet option is where you select what you think the dice will land on, if it will be higher than 7, or even and so on.
You make your selection by clicking on it.
After this, the bet setting section is similar to the previous games, use the + and - buttons to change your wager and then
press the bet button to see the result!

Please note that you cannot bet unless you have chosen an option.

# Why this is a thing #

Hi, this game has been created to test the effectiveness of chance mechanics in video games.
These mechanics are all around us when we are playing games, some are more subtle than others.

These mechanics aim to provide the user with a fun way to earn something within the game...
This can range from a new cosmetic item all the way to a rare item that gives the player an advantage.

Although this game allows users to partake in these mechanics through the use of in game currency
it is important to note that there are similar mechanics in popular video games that require the user to part
with their real world money.

This game aims to analyse how effective these mechanics are, how much will a user spend on trying to chase a winning
roll, will the user stop trying after a losing streak? Or will they keep pouring currency in the hopes of recouping all
of their loses.

I understand that this is an extremly primative way to measure this, and sice I dissagree with making users pay real money to 
get the chance of winning something, this is the closest way that I could come up with giving the in game currency a real
world value.

My thinking was that to earn the currency, users have to put time into the game, this time could be used to do other things, and 
since time is money, Im hoping that the time that users put in will somewhat give credability to my results.

Users spend currency to make currency, buying upgrades to increase the rate in which they earn currency. But if the user 
wants to speed up this process, they can play a game of chance, this chance gives the user currecy if they win and thereby
giving them the ability to upgrade more things that they would have otherwise had to have worked for.

But if the user loses the game of chance, then they have lost currency that they could have otherwise held onto and used 
to buy an upgrade in the future.

I hope to understand why these mechanics are so widely used by game developers around the world and whether or not they are as bad as 
I think they are.
