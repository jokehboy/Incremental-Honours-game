# Incremental-Honours-game
This game was created for my honours project,
I wanted to create a study that was not just a study, I remember years ago being asked by one of my older friends if I would be willing to help with their honours project and I said sure! I'd be happy to help, what am I doing? Am I watching a cool video that you created? Am I listening to something and giving my thoughts and feelings? It was nothing like that, instead, I spent the better part of an hour filling out a 10 page questionnaire and being asked interrogated about my opinion on global warming, my knowledge of it and whether or not I thought it was an issue. After that experience, I wanted to make my future honours project as painless as possible for anyone who has the misfortune of getting asked to help.

So to make it as painless as possible, I decided to make a game first and then fit the study around it second! That seems counter intuitive since the study is the project but I wanted to make the study as optional as possible, this means that the user gets to enjoy something and in the process, very naturally contribute to my study (if they wish).

As stated in the splash screen, by playing this game you agree to have analytical game based data collected, this data is anonymous and not personal whatsoever. However you can opt out, if you do not want to take part in my study and just enjoy the game.

# What data is being collected??? #

Due to the current situation, I cannot ask people to sit in a room and play my game for "Research purposes", so to overcome this, I decided to use unity analytics. Since there is no need for specific user data such as their name, age occupation etc. (which shouldn't be needed as much as it seems to be needed now to do simple tasks online) I opted to use unity analytics to just collect anonymous game data.

Unity analytics is literally just collecting a few variables from the game data script, that's it. But due to data protection laws, rules and regulations, I am obligated to tell you that I am in fact taking this data and in the process, make it sound as scary and intrusive as possible. 

Companies and advertisers have way too much data on people, a sickening amount and I want no part of it whatsoever, so to make sure that we are all on the same page with what I am collecting, I have included this section.

There are two sections to this, what I am collecting from you, which is custom game data that is unique to my game, and by that I mean this data does not exist in any other game, therefor it is custom game data. 

And the other section is what unity analytics collects by default, which I have no control or interest in whatsoever. I should explain that unity analytics is meant to be used for just that, analytics, and unity has provided developers with a great, easy to use tool to try and understand where they are going wrong, what's working and what isn't and so on. It is a tool created to give developers statistical data on their games to help with future decisions. And with that, there is some data that is collected by default that I will outline below.

I am collecting from you:

* Variables from the game data script (total currency, total product, ect.)
* That's it

What unity analytics collects by default:

* Daily and Monthly active user counts
* Average number of sessions per user.
* Total daily play time (a sum of all user time)
* Total daily play time per active user (an average of a single users play time, based on all users)
* Player retention

If you want more information on what unity analytics collects, please visit this website: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityAnalyticsOverview.html

So that's it, that is what is being collected, if you feel as if this is too much, dont hesitate to opt out!

Otherwise, if you want to help me in this study, please allow me the privilege of collecting a few variables in the background while you play my game :) 

## How to play ##

The game is very simple, click the button to earn currency, spend that currency on upgrades to improve the rate in
which currency is earned.

### Upgrades ###
On the upgrades or production page, there are upgrade panels, these panels have 6 sections.

* Upgrade name, top left of the panel, this is a short description of the upgrade.
* Upgrade level, top right of the panel, this shows you what level the current upgrade is at.
* Upgrade description, middle of the panel, this describes what the upgrade does.
* Upgrade cost, bottom of the panel, this is how much it will cost to upgrade by one level.
* Buy buttons, underneath the panel, this allows you to purchase the upgrade, there are 3 buttons, each are labelled with how many times you are buying the upgrade.
* Progress bar, underneath the buy buttons, this is a visual representation of how much currency/product you need to purchase one upgrade level.

This section is just so that you can see your progress throughout the game, they serve no purpose other than to show you how far you have came :)

### Games ###

This section of the game is where you can gamble your hard earned currency to gain more currency. There are 3 games:

* Coin flip
* Spin the wheel
* Dice roulette

#### Coin flip ####

![fsfg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27737718/113463376-448d3780-941d-11eb-854b-190cba153e5f.PNG)

If you wish to play, you must first specify how much you wish to bet using the + and - buttons on the panel.
After you have decided how much you wish to bet, you then select whether you think the outcome will be heads or tails.
Once you have made your selection, you press the bet button and cross your fingers!

#### Spin the wheel ####

![fsdfsg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27737718/113463392-5c64bb80-941d-11eb-8aac-da9cbafee1a2.PNG)

With this game, you must choose how much you want to bet using the + and - buttons within the panel.
Once you have done that, you can then bet that amount and the wheel will spin! 

#### Dice roulette ####

![fsdfsdg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27737718/113463397-625a9c80-941d-11eb-8e4d-ad52e5293e89.PNG)

This game is a little more complex but it has better payouts! There are two sections:

* Bet option 
* Bet setting

The bet option is where you select what you think the dice will land on, if it will be higher than 7, or even and so on.
You make your selection by clicking on it.
After this, the bet setting section is similar to the previous games, use the + and - buttons to change your wager and then
press the bet button to see the result!

Please note that you cannot bet unless you have chosen an option.

### Settings ###

The settings section has 4 parts to it:
* Save, import, export
* Notation
* Data collection info and opt out
* A link to this github and how to section.

#### Save and import/export ####
![sdfag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27737718/113463957-1c073c80-9421-11eb-9200-3373b1c7263e.PNG)

The game autosaves and has 5 backups, if you wish to go back to a previous save, simply delete the most recent save file, this should only be done if your current save has corrupted.

If you want to overwrite the autosave function and manually save, just click the button an it will save.

The import export section is if you wish to keep a backup of your current progress, this was added since going to the game files and copy pasting one of the save files is a pain.

To create a backup of your current game progress, simply press the export button, this will create a long encrypted string of characters. Copy and paste this somewhere for later use.

If you wish to import a previous copy of your game progress, take the long string that you copy and pasted previously and paste it into the import field. Once you have done that, press the import button and youll be back to where you exported originally! 

#### Notation ####
![dasfasg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27737718/113463964-232e4a80-9421-11eb-8a8e-0656a5d4b3d7.PNG)

This section allows you to change the notation of the numbers being displayed, since the numbers can get pretty big, number notation is needed to save screen space.

There are 3 notations to choose from:
* Scientific notation
* Engineering notation
* Letter notation

If you want info on the first two, there is alot of information online, the last one however, is a notation method that was created by incremental games to display large numbers.

Letter notation is where every time the number increases by 1e^3, a letter is placed there instead, this allows the numbers to be simplified into a smaller area of the screen.
For example, 7,910,838.00314 can be simplified into 7.911b.

#### Data collection info and opt out ####

![gsdsf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27737718/113463981-55d84300-9421-11eb-86ef-04a0ac0caef4.PNG)

As you have read, my game collects data on your gameplay and nothing else, but people should be able to exercise their right to data privacy. So if you wish to opt out, simply click on the button and it will take you to a webpage where you can opt out, see what data has been collected or delete your data from existence.

# Why this is a thing #

Hi, this game has been created to test the effectiveness of chance mechanics in video games.
These mechanics are all around us when we are playing games, some are more subtle than others.

These mechanics aim to provide the user with a fun way to earn something within the game...
This can range from a new cosmetic item all the way to a rare item that gives the player an advantage.

Although this game allows users to partake in these mechanics through the use of in game currency
it is important to note that there are similar mechanics in popular video games that require the user to part
with their real world money.

This game aims to analyse how effective these mechanics are, how much will a user spend on trying to chase a winning
roll, will the user stop trying after a losing streak? Or will they keep pouring currency in the hopes of recouping all
of their loses.

I understand that this is an extremly primative way to measure this, and sice I dissagree with making users pay real money to 
get the chance of winning something, this is the closest way that I could come up with giving the in game currency a real
world value.

My thinking was that to earn the currency, users have to put time into the game, this time could be used to do other things, and 
since time is money, Im hoping that the time that users put in will somewhat give credability to my results.

Users spend currency to make currency, buying upgrades to increase the rate in which they earn currency. But if the user 
wants to speed up this process, they can play a game of chance, this chance gives the user currecy if they win and thereby
giving them the ability to upgrade more things that they would have otherwise had to have worked for.

But if the user loses the game of chance, then they have lost currency that they could have otherwise held onto and used 
to buy an upgrade in the future.

I hope to understand why these mechanics are so widely used by game developers around the world and whether or not they are as bad as 
I think they are.
